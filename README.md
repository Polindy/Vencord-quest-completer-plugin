# Vencord-quest-completer-plugin
a plugin i made for vencord to complete quests without having to watch the videos or play the games, i used aamiaa's quest completer code and just made it into a button. i put it in by downloading the vencord source code and addind the tsx file to src/plugins and making a new folder called questCompleter then placing in the tsx file. you also must compile it and inject it to discord but new plugin yipee
also just know it currently is not working with video quests
